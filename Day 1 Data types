        of them together. Using cin leaves an end of line character which is then read by your getline(); It is best not to mix different
        types of input.The solution one could use to overcome this problem is to use a different input method. 
        On the other hand, it is always nice to get familiar with problems one might come across while coding, so take a look. 
        It is possible to overcome this problem while keeping all of your code and just adding a single line.*/
